# [Number-Converter-App] (http://abrarshariar.github.io/Number-Converter-App/)
A Qt (C++) application for number conversion [decimal, hexaddecimal, binary, octal]

[Download the application](https://github.com/abrarShariar/NumberConverter-App/archive/master.zip)

I know there are lots of tools available online for conversion between number system but I wanted to make a small and handy one for myself 
so came up with this. <br>

**Built on: Qt v.5.4**

#What is this application :
This is a a small & simple Qt destop application for quick number conversion <br>
Currently the conversions support : <br>
          -Decimal  *(base 10)* <br>
          -Hexadecimal  *(base 16)* <br>
          -Octal  *(base 8)*  <br>
          -Binary   *(base 2)*  <br>
